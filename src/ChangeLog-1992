gcalctool change history - 1992.
================================

v3.2 - patchlevel 54 [richb] - 14 Jan 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h calctool.c extern.h get.c

* Fixed #1111170 - It's a needed fix for international locales. It will fail
                   in all multi-byte locales. Text strings written to the X
                   resources files should not be localised.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 53 [richb] - 14 Jan 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h functions.c

* Fixed #1110771 -  put an LGET() around the three offending strings.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 52 [richb] - 14 Jan 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h functions.c xview.c

* Fixed #1113318 - the difference between the previous version of calctool
                   and this one is that the mode window is now pinned when
                   it's first bought up.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 51 [richb] - 14 Jan 1992.

Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h xview.c

* Fixed #1114403 - the menu was being created with a frame as owner instead
                   of NULL.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 50 [richb] - 14 Jan 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h calctool.G

* Fixed #1108519 - "Properties" is now "Properties...".

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 49 [jffowler] - 02 Nov 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h xview.c

* Temporary fix - commented out all XV_SET's of WIN_USE_IM to prevent 
  xv_error_proc from being called, just to get calctool up for 493.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 48 [jffowler] - 23 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h xview.c

* Fixed coredump - moved setting of v above first xv_set where setting 
  WIN_USE_IM was causing xv_error_proc to be called before v was set.    

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 47 [richb] - 22 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h graphics.c

* Fixed bug #1105557 - added a check to the process_str() routine to test
                       if v->error is set. If yes, then processing of the
                       selection is aborted at that point.

* Transferring bug #1105415 to xview/library.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 46 [richb] - 22 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h functions.c

* Fixed bug #1104803 - calctool didn't always reset the display correctly
                       after an error condition.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 45 [richb] - 22 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h functions.c mp.c calctool.h

* Fixed bug #1105387 - tan(90 degrees) now produces an error message, and
  Fixed bug #1102842 - tan(180 degrees) now produces 0.00 (rather than -0.00).
                       A check is now made for cos(x) == 0.0. If yes, then
                       it's an overflow error. Tan(x) is now calculated as:
                       sin(x) / cos(x). Removed mptan() function from mp.c.

* Fixed bug #1102604 - 0! now produces 1 (rather than "Error").

* Closed #1102877 - not a bug. Compared result against xcalc and two handheld
                    calculators.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 44 [richb] - 19 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h xview.c

* Adjusted the put_resource() routine in xview.c to give a pointer to the
  XrmDatabase, and not call by reference.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 43 [richb] - 13 Oct 1992.

* Files changed: CHANGES patchlevel.h calctool.h xview.c text.c functions.c
                 get.c filemgr.G

* Changed the "Set Default" button on the property sheet to "Save as Defaults".

* Fixed bug #1093905 - calctool will now look at the X resource:
                       OpenWindows.beep first and set the v->beep variable
                       accordingly. If the DeskSet calctool X resource:
                       deskset.calctool.beep is also set, this will override.

* Fixed bug #1093948 - problem with exponential numbers and memory registers.
                       Adjustments to the do_expno() routine in functions.c,
                       and do_sto_rcl() needed to set v->new_input when
                       retrieving a number from a memory register.

* Fixed bug #1098178 - allowed the character string "%s %1d already exists."
                       to be localised. New message in mess[(int) MESS_CON].

* Fixed bug #1100331 - the ibool() routine wasn't returning the correct
                       integer boolean value for hexadecimal 100000000.

* Fixed bug #1100441 - the second parameter to a call to mppwr() in
                       MPstr_to_num() in display.c should have been using an
                       integer not an MP number.

* Reclassified the xcalc bug #1093951 under x11news/program.

* Bug #1102406 isn't a bug. It displays "Error" in the calctool displays and
  beeps (assuming beeping is set), forcing the user to clear the calculator.

----

[All previous changes were by Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@Sun.COM>]

v3.2 - patchlevel 42.  5 Oct 1992.

* Fixed ifdef'd OW18N code that referenced X->frame to Calctool_kframe->kframe.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 41.  4 June 1992.

* Moved various routines, that are common to several Deskset tools, over to
  libdeskset and adjusted the files accordingly.

* Calctool would core dump when trying to retrieve the default menu string
  for the menus associated with various calctool "buttons". Added a new routine
  to xview.c called get_def_menu_str() which now correctly returns this.
  Removed the str variable from the menu_entry struct, and adjusted the code
  for this change (made menu_entries an array of char).

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 40.  1 May 1992.

* Fixed bug #1090718 - a check is made to see if the mode or memory windows
                       should be displayed, and they now no longer appear if
                       calctool is started iconically. A frame event interpose
                       handler has been added for the main calctool frame, so
                       that the current window state (open/closed) can be
                       tracked dynamically.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 39.  22 April 1992.

* Fixed bug #1084790 - calctool now recognises the -icon_font and
                       Icon.font.name options.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 38.  22 April 1992.

* Calctool has been changed so the default is a right-handed calculator. The
  manual pages have been updated.

* Made the calctool menus pinnable.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 37.  15 April 1992.

* DevGuided calctool and removed unwanted code.

* Changed the first place calctool looks for it's defaults from
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Deskset to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/Deskset.
  This fixes rfe #1087119.

* Calctools' initial size was incorrect if started with a -scale of large or
  extra_large.

* Fixed bug 1087908 - the constant window is now initially pinned.

* Fixed bug 1087911 - the function window is now initially pinned.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 36. 23rd March 1992.

* Add and remove WIN_USE_IM (I18N level 4 XView attribute).  See bugid 1083920

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 35. 27th February 1992.

* Due to the changes introduced in patch #31 for the localisation
  of the keyboard equivalents of the calctool buttons, when calctool
  was used in "right-hand" mode, the translated values were incorrect.
  Fixes bug #1084210.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 34. 24th February 1992.
 
* Ran purify on calctool. Found various memory leaks/corruptions.
  Plugged 'em. Fixes #1083925.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 33. 19th February 1992.

* More work on #1077702. Adjustment to the way the hyperbolic
  trig functions work. If calctool is display in degrees or
  gradients, then the input should not be converted to radians.
  Similarily, the output should not be converted back to degrees
  or gradients.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 32. 19th February 1992.

* calctool tried to use a localised "deskset" and "Deskset" strings
  when reading and writing its X resources. Fixes #1083402.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 31. 19th February 1992.

* The keyboard equivalents for the calctool buttons and menu entries
  have been localised. Calctool code has been adjusted to use these
  localised values, rather than the previously hard-wired values. At
  present, only a single character is allowed for each keyboard
  equivalent, and it will be taken from the first character in the
  localised string. A definition IS_KEY() has been added to calctool.h
  and used extensively in the code in case a multi-byte character
  comparison is needed. Fixed bug #1082353.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 30. 14th February 1992.

* If no initial size is given for calctool, then it will determine the
  length of the longest button label (includes the mode button labels),
  and adjust the size so that the full text for that button can be
  displayed, and the remainder of the buttons are the same size. With
  the English version, all calctool button labels should be four
  characters long, so there should be no visible change. Note that
  calctool could then be resized smaller and as much of the label as
  possible will be displayed, and if there is more text for that label,
  then the final label character will be a '>' character. Fixes bug
  #1079649.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 29. 13th February 1992.

* The Apply, Set defaults and Reset buttons were not being centralised
  on the calctool property sheet. Fixes bug #1082182.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 28. 18th January 1992.

* Line up the panel choice labels in the properties sheet using
  PANEL_LABEL_FONT to figure out the label string length
  (Font_string_dims).  This is an i18n fix.  File affected - xview.c.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 27. 17th January 1992.

* The inverse cosine of 1.0 was incorrect. It should have returned
  0.0. Fixes bug #1077702.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 26. 17th January 1992.

* Fixup from Doug Twilleager and Jackson Wong to get calctool to
  work under jup_prebeta3. Variables bminh and bminw were not
  initialised to zero in init_size() in get.c.

----

v3.2 - patchlevel 25. 16th January 1992.

* Calctool was incorrectly recognising the +Wn and -Wn command line
  options. Fixes bug #1079394.

* Small changes to the way that -fg color and -bg color are handled:

  - If the -bg command line option is present or the
    window.color.background resource set, then it will no longer change
    the background color of the button areas.

  - If the deskset.calctool.textColor resource is set, then -fg will
    not override it.

  - If the deskset.calctool.memRegisterColor resource is set, then -bg
    will not override it.

  - If the deskset.calctool.displayColor resource is set, then -bg
    will not override it.
