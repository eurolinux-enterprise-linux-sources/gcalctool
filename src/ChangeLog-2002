gcalctool change history - 2002.
================================

v4.1.27 - 24th December 2002.  (richb)

* Fixed bug #101782 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101782)

  Removed trailing "\n"'s where possible. Also removed a few inappropriate
  leading spaces before newlines. Paragraphs should hopefully format better.

----

v4.1.26 - 24th December 2002.  (richb)

* Fixed bug #101861 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101861)

  The size of the memory register window was being hard-wired. These
  fixed values have been removed, and everything is now dynamically
  sized. This should now work with any font.

----

v4.1.25 - 23th December 2002.  (richb)

* Fixed bug #101867 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101867)

  Changed multiply key from "X" to "*" (same as the existing gnome-calculator).

----

v4.1.24 - 23th December 2002.  (richb)

* Fixed bug #101780 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101780)

  Removed leading and trailing spaces from the labels for the gcalctool
  buttons.

----

v4.1.23 - 23th December 2002.  (richb)

* Fixed bug #101777 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101777)

  Removed trailing periods on the four window titles.

----

v4.1.22 - 23th December 2002.

  23th December 2002 - HideToshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@Sun.COM>
	
  * gcalctool/calctool.c:
  	Changed _() to N_() for the strings in the structure tables.
  * gcalctool/gtk.c:
  	Put _() to the strings in the set_item, set_label and set_title()
	funtcions.
  * gcalctool/graphics.c:
  	Put _() to the mode_buttons[] in button_str() function.

----

v4.1.21 - 20th December 2002.

  20th December 2002 - HideToshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@Sun.COM>
	
  * gcalctool/gtk.c:
	Added N_() macro on GtkItemFactoryMenu.
	Set a translation function to all of the gtk item factory objects.
  * gcalctool/calctool.h
	Added "config.h" in calctool.h for ENABLE_NLS.
	Changed PACKAGE to GETTEXT_PACKAGE in dgettext().
	Added N_ macro both for #ifdef ENABLE_NLS and the else case.
----

v4.1.20 - 10th September 2002.

* [Sun Bugtraq bug #1102883 against DeskSet calctool].
  If you enter 2 and select Inv, select Sin to get the arc sine value,
  "Error" is displayed on the window. Do the same thing but select Cos
  to get arc cosine value, the error message is "acos DOMAIN error",
  which is better. Sine should have the same error message to be more
  consistant.

  Fixed this by making all error messages just display "Error" which is
  more consistent.

----

v4.1.19 - 10th September 2002.

* [Sun Bugtraq bug #4006391 against CDE dtcalc].
  Bring up gcalctool, enter 10000 X 0.58 =, get answer is 5800.
  Then click on Int button, supposely should get 5800, but the answer is 5799.

  [Evaluation taken from bug #4006391:

  10000 * 0.58 = 5800

  The value displayed should be 5800. However the actual number calculated is
  5799.999999999999999999999999999...

  This value is stored in an array of type int, the array has 150 elements.
  The second field tells how many fields the integer part takes up, in this 
  case 1 as 5799 is smaller than MAX_INT. The next N cells hold the fraction 
  part.

  When we determine the Int value, we simply set the fraction part to 0, 
  which leaves us with a value of 5799].

  The fix in dtcalc for bug #4006391 is wrong. Need to set the accuracy to
  MAX_DIGITS in mpcmim() in mp.c (not 9).
 
----

v4.1.18 - 10th September 2002.

* [Sun Bugtraq bug #1258472 against CDE dtcalc].
  Start up gcalctool and set to decimal and fixed. Set accuracy to 2 decimal 
  places. Do a division like 0.19/2  It gives 0.0A

  Changes to make_number() and make_fixed(). Took the fix from bug #1258472 
  (reworked for smaller/simpler code). This introduces a min_fix 
  two-dimensional array (accurracy/base), and if we are displaying a fixed 
  number (that isn't 0.0), and mpFix is TRUE, then tests whether the number 
  to be displayed is less that the appropriate min_fix value.

  In make_fixed() we also test if dval is greater that base-1 and if it is,
  then it's reset to base-1.

* Removed all occurances of v->row and v->column as they are no longer
  needed.

----

v4.1.17 - 10th September 2002.

* [Sun Bugtraq bug #1190181 against OpenWindows DeskSet calctool].
  gcalctool core dumped if parent directory was not readable.

  Following scenario:

    % cd /tmp
    % mkdir subdir
    % cd subdir
    % mkdir asubdir
    % chmod 100 .
    % cd asubdir
    % /home/richb/rich_stuff/gcalctool/gcalctool/gcalctool
      Segmentation Fault (core dumped)

  The problem occured because gcalctool failed to handle NULL returned
  from getcwd().

  There were two occurances, in read_rcfiles() and write_rcfile(). Have
  added more bullet proofing to check if the return value of getcwd() is
  NULL.

----

v4.1.16 - 9th September 2002.

* Added all the bugs/rfe's from Sun's bugtraq database that need to be fixed
  (and/or implemented) at sometime.

* Adjusted the definition of matherr() in calctool.c so that strict ANSI C
  compilers will compile it if _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined.

* If gcalctool initially came up in BASIC mode, and you then tried to display
  one of the other modes, the buttons in the mode window would be incorrect.
  Needed to set v->modetype appropriately in make_mtable() in gtk.c just
  before get_label() was called.

----

v4.1.15 - 9th September 2002.

* With the changes made in v4.1.14, the Keys functionality no longer did 
  the correct thing when the calculator was setup as left-handed. Changes 
  made to do_keys() to get the correct index for the appropriate button.

* If you switched hands (left/right-handed), the redisplay of the calculator
  keys in the main window, did not take into effect whether the user was 
  currently showing the keyboard equivalents. This was fixed by using the 
  get_label() funcion in make_ktable() and m,ake_mtable().

* Simplified the get_label() routine to no longer return the numbers of 
  chars and spaces in the label.

----

v4.1.14 - 9th September 2002.

* If started as left-handed (gconf key "righthanded" is "false"), and the
  user is using the old OpenWindows colors (with the supplied gcalctoolrc
  file), the buttons are not colored correctly.

  Have adjusted the code so that the buttons are attached in the table in
  the appropriate positions depending upon whether it's left or right handed,
  rather than rearranging the entries in the buttons struct.

----

v4.1.13 - 30th August 2002.

* The unused buttons in the mode window are now hidden. Doing this before
  was a problem because it made the size of the remaining visible ones 
  incorrect. This now works, because the GtkTable* is now created with the
  third parameter TRUE; i.e. each button is the size of the largest one.

  This also fixes the problem where not all the unused buttons on the 
  various mode popups are colored correctly (if the user is using the 
  old OpenWindows colors (with the supplied gcalctoolrc file). Adjusted
  the supplied gcalctoolrc to remove the grey-bg and back-bg styles, and
  the mode buttons that used them.

----

v4.1.12 - 30th August 2002.

* Replaced the use of X resources with gconf schemas. Updated the manual 
  pages to reflect this change. Note this is a minimal gconf implementation.
  gcalctool doesn't actively look for other applications changing its
  key/value pairs. Also all the keys are stored as strings to make it more
  portable and easier to convert to the next resource database technology 
  when it comes along.

----

v4.1.11 - 29th August 2002.

* Explicitly setting the size of the calculator buttons has been removed.
  Each button is now the size of the largest one in that table.

* The width of the mode window is now set to be the width of the main
  calculator window (the size was previously hard-wired).

----

v4.1.10 - 29th August 2002.

* Fixes for I18N support from HideToshi Tajima <hidetoshi.tajima@sun.com>.
  Thanks!

----

v4.1.9 - 24th June 2002.

* Now that gcalctool is using Gtk resources to determine the appearance of 
  the calculator, there is no need to use the custom display_frame widget. 
  This means that the display_frame.[c,h] files are removed from the 
  distribution.

* The calculator display area now has tooltip help.

----

v4.1.8 - 21st June 2002.

* Fixed up mistakes is the gcalctool tooltip help text (as it pertains now
  to gcalctool rather than the old XView calctool).

* Three keyboard accelerators weren't working when a "menu" button had been
  pressed and the calculator was in pending mode:

  Base button - "o" (octal).
  Mode button - "l" (logical).
  Trig button - "g" (gradient).

  Extra code has been added to the frame_interpose() routine in gtk.c to
  cater for keypresses when in pending mode, that aren't automatically
  handled by existing keyboard accelerators.

* The + and . keys on the numeric keypad don't work.
  (See: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79184)
  For now, explicit code has been added to frame_interpose() in gtk.c to
  handle these two keys. This should be removed when 79184 is fixed.

----

v4.1.7 - 20th June 2002.

* Added in help support. Hitting the Help key will toggle whether tooltip
  help messages are displayed for the various buttons and other widgets.

  By default tooltips are disabled. Start gcalctool with the "-h" command
  line option will enable them. There is also a "gcalctool.showhelp"
  resource that can enable/disdable them. 

  Used the text from the calctool.info file in the XView distribution for 
  the tooltip messages.

  The manual pages have been updated to reflect these changes.

----

v4.1.6 - 20th June 2002.

* The new Constant/Function popup now has the various items aligned.

----

v4.1.5 - 20th June 2002.

* The size of the buttons in the Mode window are incorrect if the unused ones
  are not shown. Solved this my simply making the unused ones insnsitive, and
  showing them all.

----

v4.1.4 - 19th June 2002.

* Keyboard accelerators now work for the gcalctool "menu" buttons. Needed to
  add a g_signal_connect( ... "clicked" ...) callback for all buttons, not
  just the non-menu" buttons.

----

v4.1.3 - 14th June 2002.

* The constant and function definitions are now read and written to a file
  named ~/.gcalctoolcf  now (was ~/.gcalctoolrc). Manual pages also updated
  to reflect this change.

* gcalctool now also tries to read a ~/.gcalctoolrc file at startup time.
  This file (if it exists) can contain resources for changing the appearance
  of the application. A gcalctoolrc file is now also included with the
  gcalctool distribution, which gives the old OpenWindows DeskSet appearance
  to the calculator.

* The ability to change various colors via X resources has also been removed.
  The manual pages have been updated to reflect this.

  This change means that all code related to colors has been removed from
  gcalctool. color.h has been removed from the distribution.

----

v4.1.2 - 13th June 2002.

* Removed all the code in gtk.c that was surronded by #ifdef FIXUP.

* Starting gcalctool then switching hands to left-handed, then using the
  keyboard for input wrongly associates the various keyboard accelerators
  for the swapped keys.

  Reworked the logic in set_prop_options() in gtk.c. Needed to remove the
  keyboard accelerators for the old buttons, before the keyboard layout
  was switched.

----

v4.1.1 - 13th June 2002.

* Adjusted configure.in to find the X11 libraries in a platform independent
  way.

* Fixed up the gcalctool usage message. Removed command line options that 
  are no longer applicable to the Gtk2 version.

* Fixed up the gcalctool manual pages (removed calctool.1 and created a new
  gcalctool.1). Fixes include:
  - changing all occurances of "calctool" to "gcalctool".
  - removing command line options that are no longer supported.
  - removing X resources that are no longer supported.

* gcalctool now looks for ~/.gcalctoolrc and ~/.gcalctooldefaults files 
  rather than ~/.calctoolrc and ~/.calctooldefaults

* X resources are not "gcalctool.<whatever" rather than "calctool.<whatever>".

----

v4.1.0 - 3rd May - 5th June 2002.

* Started work on a Gtk2 version:

  - Create an automake/autoconf environment that builts against the Solaris
    GNOME 2 beta3 release.

  - Conversion of the XView graphics to Gtk2: 
    . Added new gtk.c source file and removed xview.c.
    . Converted .icon files to .xbm files.

    Note that the code is no longer easily portable to other graphic toolkits,
    and now uses higher level graphic widgets. This reduced the code line 
    count by over 5000.

  - Del key wasn't being recognized. For XView was '\177'; for Gtk2 need
    to use values in <gdk/gdkkeysyms.h>. Change needed in text.c for setting 
    the .value entry on the button structure for the del key, to be an int 
    not a char. Also had to adjust get_key_val to return an int. menu_entries 
    changed to array of int's not char's.

  - The Control-L keyboard accelerator (used to refresh the display) has been
    removed. Everything is a high-level widget now, so automatic redrawing
    should occur.

  - Cut and Paste function keys now do the right thing.
  - Switching "hands" now works from the calctool property sheet.

  - Removed the "Display: [color][monochrome]" option from the property sheet,
    fixed up the code to no longer care about this option, and removed the
    associated command line options and X property.

  - Two fprintf() statements in the mpchk() routine in mp.c did not have their
    numeric arguments.

  - Fixed up all the deprecated Gtk calls.
    Modify CFLAGS to add:

      -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED 
      -DGDK_PIXBUF_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
      -DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED 
      -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

    then fixed up the warnings and errors that were reported.

  - This version placed into CVS on cvs.gnome.org as module "gcalctool".

----

v4.0.0 - 26th February 2002.

  26th February 2002 - Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@Sun.COM>

  Preparation for releasing the calctool sources to the community:

  - Added "#define OWTOOLKIT_WARNING_DISABLED" to calctool_ui.c and xview.c

  - Added code into calctool_ui.c from:

    /net/dtserver/export/src_998/MASTER_OL3.0/external/DeskSet/V3_release:
    .../audiotool/guide/libguidexv/group.h
    .../audiotool/guide/libguide/guide.h
    .../audiotool/guide/libguidexv/group_impl.h

    This file also includes dummy routines for:

    group_destroy()
    group_set()
    group_get()
    group_init()

    and a definition for group_pkg.

  - Created dsdefs.h which includes definitions from:

    /net/dtserver/export/src_300/PMASTER_OL300/external/DeskSet:
    .../libdeskset/ds_popup.h
    .../libdeskset/ds_xlib.h

    Adjusted calctool_ui.c and xview.c to call this.

  - Create dsfuns.c which includes code from:

    /net/dtserver/export/src_300/PMASTER_OL300/external/DeskSet:
    .../libdeskset/ds_xlib.c
    .../libdeskset/ds_popup.c
    .../libdeskset/ds_pathname.c
    .../libdeskset/ds_hostname.c

  - Fixed up one of the compiler warnings in xview.c

  - Adjusted the build environment to use autoconf and automake.

  - Moved all the image file into the .../calctool/calctool directory, and
    adjusted calctool_ui.c, graphics.c and xview.c accordingly.

  - Adjusted all the copyright notices to have dates upto 2002.

  - Fixed up most of the warnings generated by the Gnu compiler and lint.

  - Removed patchlevel.h and replaced it with VERSION from config.h

  - Adjusted the code to K&R style.

  - Removed the "calctool_" prefix on all names in calctool_ui.c and
    calctool_ui.h (and calls in xview.c).

  - Created AUTHORS, NEWS and README files.

  - Adjusted the calctool manual pages to remove references to the Solaris
    User's Guide and the note to indicate that the OpenWindows environment
    may no longer be supported in a future release.
